# Introduction
This is a toy RESTful API providing an interface to post feedbacks about something.
Those feedbacks can be upvoted or downvoted by other users.
They can also be commented.
Comments are subject to votes as well, but cannot be further commented at a secondary level.
As such the comments tree is linear and related to a single feedback.

# Technical overview
The API is written in Python and based on Flask and SQLAlchemy.
Resources are stored in a SQLite database.
An ORM is used to interact with the DB.

feedAPI/bootstrap.sh is script used to setup the DB if not found and start the flask server on port 5000 ;
feedAPI/index.py contains route definitions ;
feedAPI/model/tables.py contains a declarative mapping of the tables ;
feedAPI/database.db is the database file (generated by bootstrap.sh - ignored by git) ;
requirements.txt contains the python packages for easy venv deployment.

Routes are defined within Flask to answer different HTTP requests (GET, POST and PUT).
The following route are defined :
* /feedback (GET) to fetch all feedbacks ;
* /feedback/<id>/comments (GET) to fetch the comment related to feedback with id <id>;
* /feedback/<id> (GET) to fetch feedback with id <id> ;
* /comment/<id> (GET) to fetch comment with id <id> ;
* /feedback (POST) to post a feedback ;
* /comment (POST) to post a feedback ;
* /feedback/<id> (PUT) to react to feedback of id <id> ;
* /comment/<id> (PUT) to react to comment of id <id>.


# Initial thoughts on the project
## Choose which paradigme to use
A RESTful API seemed like a good choice.
Microservices are all the rage but for such a little application it would be overkill.
Plus I have never worked with this paradigm.
But I understand the attraction and as I have three services to implement it is still a valid choice.
As I am to focus on the back-end I also chose to setup a SQLite db and use it directly if come to the front-end instead of local data.
Two tables seem sufficient, one for the feedbacks and the other for the reactions to the feedback

## Choose a technology stack
As I have never used NodeJS I decided to implement the service in Python.

I have used Flask in the past and I knew it is simple enough to setup.
A quick search confirmed it would provide all I need for a REST implementation.
If installed with [async], we can get Flask to respond asynchronically to requests.
Flask-SQLAlchemy will be used as an ORM to interact with the DB.

As for  the db, I will use SQLite as it is adequate for a small project like this.

# Development process
## Preparation
### Venv and PIP
I setup a virtual env to install necessary Python package with PIP, listed in requirements.txt
I do this to not mix between python packages managed by my OS package manager and those that I must install with PIP.
It also make the project easily portable.
### Git
Init a git repo and switch to a dev branch

## Code
### Basic Flask server
Create a working Flask server, responding to HTTP queries and verify it's working.
### Base module with classes
I setup a model module with two classes, one for the feedback table and the other for the reaction table
Reactions can be a comment about a feedback,
