# Initial thoughts on the project
## Choose which paradigme to use
A RESTful API seemed like a good choice.
Microservices are all the rage but for such a little application it would be overkill.
Plus I have never worked with this paradigm.
But I understand the attraction and as I have three services to implement it is still a valid choice.
As I am to focus on the back-end I also chose to setup a SQL db and use it directly if come to the front-end instead of local data.

## Choose a technology stack
As I have never used NodeJS I decided implement the service in Python.

I have used Flask in the past and I knew it is simple enough to setup.
A quick search confirmed it would provide all I need for a REST implementation.

# Development process
## Venv
I setup a virtual env to install necessary Python package, as of now: Flask.
## Git
Init a git repo and switch to a dev branch
